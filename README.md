Welcome!

The idea here is to do just about everything in Pure Untyped Lambda Calculus.
(Exceptions will be things of necessity like printing out results.)

I LOVE the Lambda Calculus. It is the simplest programming language in the world.

To be able to build complex structures that work reliably out of a language with just a couple syntax and substitution rules is a joy.
I chose to use Racket because it was the first language I could find that seemed to give me the tools I needed for doing this as simply as possible.

So far I have defined:
	- boolean values and logical operators
	- church numerals and arithmetic operators
	- equalities and inequalities
	- recursion using the Y-Combinator and some recursive functions
	- more advanced arithmetic (defined division and integers with operators for them)
	- pairs and lists with operators for them
	- algorithms (so far only binary search for church numerals and integers)

How to Run:
	- download Racket and lazy package
	- from project root, run racket test.rkt
